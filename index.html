<p><a href="http://et.kmjch.net">Eat Together</a> is a project I made as a student of <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a>, an immersive coding program I finished December 2016.  I'm currently interviewing for software engineering roles in which I can learn and contribute as much as I can.  Thanks for visiting!</p>
